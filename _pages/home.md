<p>Transformative single-cell multi-omics and spatial technologies now provide an opportunity to dissect the state of individual cells at unprecedented resolution. Given the rapid development of different single-cell biotechnologies and new wave of big omics data with their own specificities in terms of complexity and information content, our aims is to use computational and theoretical approaches combined with multi-omics high-throughput sequencing data to quantitatively address the full-scale complexity of biological systems and derive novel biological insights. We are building an interdisciplinary team to tightly link computation and biological technologies, and gradually set up wet experiment systems for validating computationally inferred hypotheses. We will always be eager to seek collaborations, such as cancer immunology, within our rich scientific community to push forward our understandings of regulation mechanism and yield new therapeutic approaches for human disease treatment.</p>

<!-- Advances in single-cell technologies, especially for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), are providing exciting opportunities for describing the characteristics and heterogeneity of individual cells and benefiting the study of cell identity, fate and function with unprecedented resolution (Stuart and Satija, 2019). Recent studies have also shown that identical cell types may have tissue-specific expression patterns, indicating that tissue environment plays an important role in mediating cell states. The loss of spatial information during the process of tissue dissociation and cell isolation will limit our understanding of cellular interactions and organization in the microenvironment. Recently, a number of methods providing spatially resolved transcriptomic profiling have been introduced and are complementary to scRNA-seq (Asp et al., 2020). Some studies, for example, from development, stem cell, cancer and immunology fields, clearly highlight the power of scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomes for parsing the spatial context in high resolution (Baccin et al., 2020; Moncada et al., 2020). However, due to technical limitations and complexity of data structure, there are some unique computational challenges need to be addressed for advancing the field of single-cell omics
