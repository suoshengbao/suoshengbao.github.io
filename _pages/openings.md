## Open positions

<p>Our lab mainly use and develop computational and theoretical approaches based on multi-omics high-throughput sequencing data, but also establish wet-lab experiments if needed, to systematically understand regulation mechanisms in single-cell and spatial level, with focus on questions in immunology. </p>
<p>We are always looking for creative, energetic and collaborative **student** and **postdoc** to join our interdisciplinary team!</p>



### Postdoc
<p>The candidates will have (or about to have) a Ph.D. in computational biology/bioinformatics/computer science/statistics or other quantitative fields, as well as excellent programming and communication skills. Substantial experience in analysis of high-throughput sequencing data is highly desirable.</p>

<p>Candidates with a Ph.D. degree in bioinformatics, computational science, compulational biology, immunology (etc.) with substantial experience and interest in quantitative fields/programming are also welcomed to apply.</p>

<p>The candidates would have ability to develop independent research programs/projects</p>

<p>The successful candidates will join a vibrant scientific environment devoted to basic science aiming at integrating research activities among partner institutes and conduct interdisciplinary research to address high-priority projects through the combination of complementary knowledge, methods and techniques.</p>

<p>If you are interested in joining us, please send us an email along with a brief cover letter, a detailed CV and at least two recommendation letters. Please indicate “Application Postdoc (Your name)” in the email subject.</p>


### Research Assistant
